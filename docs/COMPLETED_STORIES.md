| US‑001 | Semester timeline & navigation       | As a student planning my semesters, I want to scroll or use arrows to move between semester cards so that I can quickly review and compare plans. | Terrence | Gavin           | views.js, state_nav.js           | Use arrow keys or scroll to move; confirm the highlighted card changes and the credit total displays.                   |
| US‑002 | Add classes with prerequisite checks | As a student, I want to add courses from a modal that blocks unmet prerequisites so that I don’t schedule classes I’m not ready for.              | Phillip  | Gavin           | search.js, actions.js, routes.py | Open the modal, try adding a course missing prerequisites (it should be disabled), then add a valid course.             |
| US‑003 | Course search (unassigned)           | As a student, I want to search the catalog and hide classes I already planned so that I only see new options.                                     | Phillip  | Gavin           | routes.py                        | Search by code or title; after adding a class, search again and observe it no longer appears when filtering unassigned. |
| US‑004 | Delete class & keep order            | As a student, I want to remove a class and keep the list tidy so that the semester stays organized.                                               | Shaq     | —               | menu.js, views.js                | Add three classes, delete the middle one, and check that the list order is still clean without gaps.                    |
| US‑005 | Group progress bar                   | As a student, I want to see progress bars for requirement groups so that I can track how many courses I’ve planned toward each goal.              | Phillip  | Gavin           | actions.js                       | Add a course from a group; the bar increases. Remove it; the bar decreases.                                             |
| US‑006 | Offering chips & term note           | As a student, I want to know when a course is typically offered so that I plan in a term when it’s available.                                     | Melisa   | —               | planner.css                      | Open the modal; verify Spring/Summer/Fall chips and a note if a course isn’t typically offered this term.               |
| US‑008 | Limit classes and credits            | As a student, I want the system to prevent too many classes or credits so that my plan stays realistic.                                           | Gavin    | Phillip         | routes.py                        | Try to add beyond the allowed counts/credits; expect a friendly error and no overages.                                  |
| US‑009 | Seed catalog & degree data           | As a team, we want reliable demo data (catalog, offerings, prereqs, programs) so that anyone can run and test the app quickly.                    | Gavin    | Melisa, Phillip | seed_courses.py, models.py       | Run the seed twice; the data stays clean without duplicates and the app boots with a demo user.                         |
| US‑010 | Prerequisite policy by term          | As a student, I want prerequisite checks to respect earlier/same/later terms so that concurrent enrollment rules are handled correctly.           | Gavin    | Phillip         | routes.py                        | Place prereqs in earlier, same, and later terms; verify only allowed cases count.                                       |
| US‑011 | Requirements progress API            | As a student, I want an API that reports planned vs required counts so that the UI can show my progress clearly.                                  | Gavin    | Phillip         | routes.py                        | Add and remove planned courses; call the endpoint and see counts change appropriately.                                  |
| US‑012 | Semester order normalization         | As a student, I want semesters to stay in a clear order so that navigation and display remain consistent.                                         | Terrence | Gavin           | routes.py, state_nav.js          | Shuffle orders, reload, and verify they normalize to a tidy 0..N‑1 sequence.                                            |
| US‑013 | Grouped modal with sticky headers    | As a student, I want courses grouped under clear headings with sticky headers so that browsing large lists feels organized.                       | Melisa   | —               | planner.css, search.js           | Open the modal and scroll; headers stay visible and groups can expand/collapse.                                         |

| US‑015 | Context menu & toasts                | As a student, I want a simple actions menu and clear messages so that common tasks (like delete) are easy and obvious.                            | Shaq     | —               | menu.js, toast.js                | Open the menu, perform an action, and see a toast confirm success or explain an error.                                  |
